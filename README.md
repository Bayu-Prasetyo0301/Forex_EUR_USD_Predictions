# MACHINE LEARNING MODELS
# Forex EUR_USD Predictions

# üìù Description
This project aims to apply machine learning techniques for time series forecasting using historical EUR/USD Forex data. The data spans from 2002 to 2019 and captures essential market movements over 17 years.
We focus on building models that can detect patterns, trends, and seasonality to make future price predictions.
Throughout the project, we experiment with both traditional machine learning models and deep learning approaches for time series analysis.

While accurate financial prediction is impossible, this project serves as an excellent opportunity to strengthen skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, evaluation, and visualization ‚Äî all of which are crucial components in the field of data science and finance.

# üìö Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the EUR/USD Forex pair using historical time series data from 2002 to 2019. Through machine learning techniques, the goal is to explore trends, patterns, and forecast future price movements.

# Dataset Source:
EUR/USD Forex Historical Data 2002‚Äì2019 - Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imetomi/eur-usd-forex-pair-historical-data-2002-2019

# GitHub Repository:

# üõ†Ô∏è Stack / Tools Used:

- TensorFlow (tensorflow) : Used to build, train, and evaluate machine learning models, especially deep learning models like LSTM for time series forecasting.

- Pandas (pandas) : Utilized for data manipulation, cleaning, and table-based data exploration (DataFrames).

- NumPy (numpy) : Provides numerical computing, array operations, and efficient mathematical computations.

- OS (os) : Enables interaction with the file system and directory management.

- Time (time) : Used for execution delays and measuring the duration of operations.

- Datetime (datetime) : Handles and formats time and date values, essential for time series data.

- Matplotlib (matplotlib.pyplot) : Used for creating standard data visualizations such as line plots, scatter plots, and more.

- Pandas TA (pandas_ta) : A library to calculate technical analysis indicators like Moving Averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.

- Scikit-learn (sklearn.preprocessing) : MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler are used for data normalization and standardization before model training.

- Plotly (plotly.graph_objects) : Provides interactive visualizations such as candlestick charts, line graphs, and 3D plots.

- mplfinance : Used for plotting candlestick charts and financial trading visualizations based on matplotlib.

- Pydot (pydot) : Allows the creation and rendering of graphs and diagrams, often used for visualizing deep learning model architectures.

# üìä Approach
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends, seasonality, and correlations.

- Feature Engineering: Creating additional relevant features.

- Model Building: Traditional ML models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)

- Time Series models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM)

- Model Evaluation: Measuring performance with MAE, RMSE, etc.

- Forecasting: Making predictions and plotting future trends.

# üìå Important Note
Accurately predicting market behavior remains an unattainable goal, whether using fundamental analysis, technical analysis, or machine learning techniques.
This project is intended purely for educational purposes, focusing on the exploration of time series forecasting.
Nevertheless, I hope this project provides you with meaningful insights and a deeper understanding of predictive modeling.
